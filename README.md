# Package Your Code - Data Science Mini-Conference Workshop

This repository contains materials for the "Package Your Code" workshop held at the Data Science Mini-Conference. The workshop aims to teach participants how to package their code effectively for better collaboration, distribution, and reuse.

## Workshop Overview

In the live section of this workshop, we will cover the following topics:

1. **Dependency Management**: Learning how to manage project dependencies using tools like `uv` and splitting dependencies into production, development, and documentation categories.
2. **Packaging with `pyproject.toml`**: Understanding the structure and purpose of `pyproject.toml` files, and how to use them to define project metadata and dependencies so you can reuse your code in other projects.
3. **Mkdocs and Mkdocstrings**: Setting up documentation for your project using `mkdocs` and `mkdocstrings` to create user-friendly and maintainable documentation.

There is also bonus content available in the repository, which can be explored at your own pace, including:

1. **Cookiecutter Templates**: Using cookiecutter templates to quickly scaffold new projects with best practices in mind.
2. **Setting up Pre-Commit Hooks**: Implementing pre-commit hooks to automate code quality checks, enforcing coding standards, and preventing secrets from being committed to version control.
3. **Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automating testing, building, and deploying your code using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Pre-requisite Knowledge

The workshop assumes that participants have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

| Pre-requisite | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Python        | Knowledge of how to write and run Python code |
| Git           | Basic command line usage and version control concepts |
| GitHub        | Familiarity with repositories, Codespaces, and forking |
| RAP           | Understanding of the core principles of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP), particularly the [levels of RAP](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP) |
| Virtual Environments & Package Management | Basic understanding of virtual environments and package management in Python (e.g., `pip`, `venv`, `conda`, etc.) |
