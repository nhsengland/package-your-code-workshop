3. Click "Create fork" to confirm.

## Open in GitHub Codespaces

1. In your forked repository, click the green "Code" button.
2. Select the "Codespaces" tab.
3. Click "Create codespace on main" to launch a new Codespace instance. This may take a few moments to set up.
4. Once the Codespace is ready, you will be taken to a VS Code environment in your browser. The repository will be cloned, and the development environment will be configured automatically, give it a few moments to finish setting up.

## Fire Up the MkDocs Server
