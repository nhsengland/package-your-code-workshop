# Workshop Context - Why is any of this important?

## I want to make Gold RAP easy and the default

It can be a lot easier to build Gold RAP pipelines if you are doing it from the start and/or it is baked into your workflow and the project plan.

I want to make sure you know how you can do this stuff easily and effectively.

I want us to build tools and templates to make it easy for you to do this stuff, so it becomes the default; you can be lazy and still do Gold RAP, allowing you focus on doing great Data Science. However, we need to do the learning and the work to develop these skills and find the lazy desired paths first.

I hope this workshop helps you start to do that and you can help figure out solutions to to how we make Gold RAP the easy, lazy default.
