## Joe Wilson - Data Scientist at NHS England

GitHub - [josephwilson8-nhs](https://github.com/josephwilson8-nhs)

* Background in Aerospace Engineering and Data Science
* I code mainly in Python, but also in R and SQL (and LabVIEW from my engineering days)
* I have been working in the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) space for a lot of my last four years at NHS England
    * Currently an embedded Data Scientist in the Direct Commissioning Data and Analytics team
* I am the Tech Lead for Gold RAP Delivery
    * This means our pipelines are built to a high standard, using best practices, and can be seen as a reusable, deployable product.
    * My mission: To make that easy, default behaviour for everyone

In the live workshop, I am joined by:

* Jen Struthers - [jenniferstruthers1-nhs](https://github.com/jenniferstruthers1-nhs)
* Warren Davies - [warren-davies4](https://github.com/warren-davies4)
