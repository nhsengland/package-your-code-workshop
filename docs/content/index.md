# Package Your Code Workshop

Welcome to the **Package Your Code** workshop! This workshop is designed to teach NHS data scientists and analysts how to package their code effectively for better collaboration, distribution, and reuse. In this workshop, you'll master the essential skills for creating professional, reusable Python packages. You'll learn how to manage dependencies, package your code using modern standards, and create comprehensive documentation.
